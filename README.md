## <h2 align="center">Project Insight</h2>
Initially, this project started off as me wanting to learn more about machine learning. I wanted to make my own augmented reality landmark detector model, which when you point your phone at a landmark, the model would detect the landmark and then give you live overlays of information about that landmark, e.g a short description, when it was made etc. Originally, the project was just meant to feature the landmark detection model plus overlay the information and that would be the sole purpose of my "tourist app". However, some days went by and then more ideas came into my head. I envisioned this as a social media app where tourists as well as locals of Kathmandu could connect with each other by sharing their experiences around the city at landmarks, restaurants etc. and receive a virtual tour of landmarks through the model, replacing the need for a tour guide. I am currently attempting to make this vision of mine into a reality. While this is just a personal project, I may release this app later on if all goes well.

In the docs folder of this project, I've made sure to feature a **_daily log_** file, which sort of acts as a journal for this project. I update that daily as Im working through the project, it also lists errors/challenges I encountered and solutions if i manage to find any.
