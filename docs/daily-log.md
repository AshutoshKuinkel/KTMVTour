## 30 Sept 25

- Initialised folder structure.
- Added photos of the two landmarks using ICrawler.
- Watched a video on transfer learning using TensorFlow + mobilenetv2 from code basics.
- setup the transfer learning in training-model.py file using tensor flow

## 1 Oct 25

- Continued working through traning-model.py transfer learning
- currently getting typeerror problem:

```bash
  Traceback (most recent call last):

  raise ValueError(
  ValueError: Only instances of `keras.Layer` can be added to a Sequential model. Received: <tensorflow_hub.keras_layer.KerasLayer object at 0x000001E2F98C0F10> (of type <class 'tensorflow_hub.keras_layer. KerasLayer'>)
```

- I wrote about how I solved it here on github (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/63849#issuecomment-3354405639):

- Btw the lambda layer wraps a function and does not declare its input shape. Previously our hub.KerasLayer declared the input shape, so TensorFlow could build model right away. 
but with lamda, we need to tell the model what kind of input shape its taking by just declaring it like this: tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(img_height,img_width, 3)), e.g (224,224,3)
